Hello. I am currently taking a midterm exam where the use of AI is permitted. The exam is based on the "OverTheWire Bandit" wargame, specifically levels 1 through 20. I will be working in a Virtual Box environment.

I will be sending you the specific problem descriptions and questions from my exam. They will be similar to Bandit level challenges.

Your task is to research and provide me with the most efficient and concise Linux commands or small code snippets to solve each problem. I need direct answers that I can execute quickly to progress to the next level.

Please confirm you understand. My first question is coming shortly.
